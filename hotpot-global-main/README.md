POC NFT Marketplace &amp; Hotpot Raffle DApp

"An innovative blend of NFT marketplace and raffle system powered by Ethereum smart contracts and Web3 technologies. This Decentralized Application (DApp) brings together the dynamic world of NFTs and the thrill of raffles in a fully transparent, secure, and user-friendly manner.

The DApp allows users to browse and purchase NFTs via a user-friendly marketplace, and participate in Hotpot raffles for a chance to win valuable NFTs. Under the hood, it leverages Ethereum smart contracts for the core logic, Chainlink VRF for provably fair randomness in raffle winner selection, and IPFS for decentralized storage of NFT metadata, achieving true decentralization and censorship resistance.

Our backend handles wallet integration, transaction creation and broadcasting, event listening, state management, and interaction with the Ethereum network and IPFS, ensuring a smooth user experience. The DApp is developed with a security-first mindset, incorporating best practices in web3 security and error handling.

Built with love using Solidity, ethers.js, Node.js, and React, this project showcases the powerful synergy between blockchain, DeFi, and the NFT space. Explore, trade, and win NFTs with us in this exciting Web3 adventure!"
